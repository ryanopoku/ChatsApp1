/** This UIViewController category provides convenience methods for instantiation and launch of C2Call SDK GUI component.
 
 The C2Call SDK provides feature rich components for rich media content handling and social media communication features.
 The basic concept of this SDK is, to combine convenience and ease of use with great flexibility for all provided components.
 The UIViewController+SCCustomViewController category provides easy access to those components, whether they will be used as standard components from SCStoryboard or as customized components from the MainStoryboard of the developed application.
 
 In iOS Storyboard an UIViewController represents one screen of content and the transitions between two UIViewControllers will be defined by an UIStoryboardSegue.
 In C2Call SDK the UIViewController based GUI components will be also presented via UIStoryboardSegue, so that the developer can define the transition in his MainStoryboard. Several components require one or more parameters, which typically have to be set in method prepareForSegue:sender. 
 The UIViewController+SCCustomViewController provides convenience methods to present C2Call SDK GUI components with a one or two lines of code and ensures that required parameter will be correctly set in the presented ViewController.
 
 
 The following GUI components are supported:

    Presenting Rich Media Content
    - SCComposeMessageController (Composes and submit a new Instant Message, 
      Rich Media Message or SMS/Text Message to a user or phone number)
    - SCPhotoViewerController (Presents photos)
    - SCVideoPlayerController (Presents a Video Player)
    - SCLocationViewerController (Presents a location in a map view)
    - SCAudioPlayerController (Presents an Audio Player for VoiceMails)
    
    Capture Rich Media Content:
    - UIImagePickerController (Captures an Image or Video from Camera or Photo Album with Quality)
    - SCAudioRecorderController (Records and submits a VoiceMail)
    - SCLocationSubmitController (Picks and submits the current location or nearby Google places)
    
    Show Friends, Groups and Chat History:
    - SCChatController (Presents a Chat History with a specific contact)
    - SCFriendDetailController (Presents the details of a connected friend)
    - SCGroupDetailController (Presents the details of a connected group)
 
    Others:
    - SCBrowserViewController (Opens an URL in a Browser View)
 
 In case the developer connects the above components in his MainStoryboard via UIStoryboardSegue the segues have to be named with a specific name convention in order to handle the parameters setup in prepareForSegue:sender correctly. Each connected UIStoryboardSegue has to be named like the target ViewControllers original class name, for example:

    Target UIViewController Class           Segue Name
    SCComposeMessageController      ->      SCComposeMessageControllerSegue
    SCPhotoViewerController         ->      SCPhotoViewerControllerSegue
    SCVideoPlayerController         ->      SCVideoPlayerControllerSegue
    SCLocationViewerController      ->      SCLocationViewerControllerSegue
    etc.
 
 In addition to this naming convention, the developer needs to call customPrepareForSegue:sender in his prepareForSegue:sender method:
 
    -(void) prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue*) segue sender:(id) sender
    {
        [self customPrepareForSegue:segue sendersender];
 
        // Do your own setup
        ...
    }
 
 All ViewControllers covered by this UIViewController category can be also presented without UIStoryboardSegue connections.
 In this case the component will be instantiated from MainStoryboard and if not found there, from SCStoryboard. 
 It'll push the component if the current ViewController is embedded in a UINavigationController and present modal else.
 We recommend to use UIStoryboardSegue if the developers wants to have full control on this behavior.
